# VIBE AVATAR

Our project involves creating personalized playlist covers based on the content and musical attributes of a user's created or followed playlists, utilizing OpenAI's GPT-3.5 for playlist analysis and DALL¬∑E for generating the artwork that matches the playlist's style. The project uses Vue, adopting the MVVM architecture, and employs Pinia as the store library and state management framework.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur).

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vitejs.dev/config/).

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Type-Check, Compile and Minify for Production

npm run build
```
